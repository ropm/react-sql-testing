# React - MySQL test project

## Products management app

Uses React frontend to fetch data via a products server API. 

Server is a nodeJS, express server which gets data from MySQL database. 
It uses basic .get requests, so the next step would be to update the two delete and add .get requests to .post requests.

This project was made just for practise.
